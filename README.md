# Interview Project: _Vitruvi_

## Description

This repository houses my interview project for **Vitruvi**.

My task is to develop a Single Page Application using _Angular2+_ or _React_ that keep track of tasks with the following requirements:

- Present visually a list of tasks in three different states: Planned, In Progress, and Completed.
- Each task contains: name, description, estimate duration, and state.
- The user has to be able to add/remove a task and edit its characteristics.
- For each state, the application has to show an up-to-date status adding up the duration of all tasks.

##### Note: _This is a single user application and it does not store data._

**Please enjoy!**
